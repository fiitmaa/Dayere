An educational animation showing how to derive the area of a circle formula.

Scene 1: A perfect circle with radius "r" is drawn. The circle is divided into 8 equal triangular slices like a pizza.
Scene 2: The 8 slices are separated slightly to show they are individual pieces.
Scene 3: The slices are rearranged: 4 pieces placed in a row with alternating orientation (one upright, one upside down), and the other 4 pieces placed in a second row above them.
Scene 4: The arranged pieces form a parallelogram shape. Text appears: "This shape resembles a rectangle".
Scene 5: As we increase the number of pieces, the shape becomes a perfect rectangle.
Scene 6: The length of this rectangle equals half the circumference: πr. The width equals the radius: r.
Scene 7: Area of rectangle = length × width = πr × r = πr²
Scene 8: Final formula appears: Area of Circle = πr²

Style: Clean 2D animation, educational, colorful pieces, mathematical symbols, smooth transitions.# Dayere
